function [J, grad] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda)
%LRCOSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression with 
%regularization
%   J = LRCOSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y, lambda) computes the cost of using
%   theta as the parameter for regularized logistic regression and the
%   gradient of the cost w.r.t. to the parameters. 

% Initialize some useful values
m = length(y); % number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
grad = zeros(size(theta));

% ====================== The Code Written By Muhammet Durmaz======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
%               You should set J to the cost.
%               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
%               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
%
% Hint: The computation of the cost function and gradients can be
%       efficiently vectorized. For example, consider the computation
%
%           sigmoid(X * theta)
%
%       Each row of the resulting matrix will contain the value of the
%       prediction for that example. You can make use of this to vectorize
%       the cost function and gradient computations. 
%
% Hint: When computing the gradient of the regularized cost function, 
%       there're many possible vectorized solutions, but one solution
%       looks like:
%           
temp=theta;
temp(1,1)=0;
h_x=sigmoid(X*theta);
J=1/m*sum(-y.*log(h_x)-(1-y).*log(1-h_x))+lambda/(2*m)*(transpose(temp)*temp);
error=h_x-y;
grad=1/m*transpose(X)*error;
grad=grad+lambda/m*temp;







% =============================================================

grad = grad(:);
